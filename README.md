this is my way of managing my windows. I believe it should be useful and/or at least interesting to many.

once I log in to my computer I see a welcome message. That's when I know it's ready to accept my commands. There is nothing else to distract me. A blank screen is what I love (usually blue) to start with.  Then I start commanding the computer and see the result of things I want from it. That's what I call a desktop environment that get's the hell out of my way.


on my computer everything is in full screen. no tiling windows (I explain later why) 

If I want to open firefox I press <kbd>F9</kbd> and then <kbd>f</kbd>. 

To computer these key seq means:
<kbd>F9</kbd>: hey... here is what I want you to do. 
<kbd>f</kbd>:  switch to the firefox window or start firefox if it's not yet runnyng

lets start a terminal window... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd>

lets open emacs. easy... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd>

now I want to go back to firefox... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>

press <kbd>F8</kbd> if you want to switch between last to visited windows...

F8 ... and I'm back at my emacs window...

Neat ha? 

There is no numbers... tags... or anything to remember just the first letter of the the apps. Too bad this will never work on mac... everything starts with i... :)

So why <kbd>F9</kbd> and <kbd>F8</kbd>... 

- very few apps use them.
- easy to reach with the most powerful fingers of the right hand.
- no need to mess around with your alt or ctrl key... which is good for a lot of emacs users.

So if you are interested in the way this way of computing... then grab my-stumpwmrc and through it at your stumpwm.

If you do not know what stumpwm is... it's basically a very hackable window manager you can easily install it on your favorite linux distro from their repos.

Have fun!
