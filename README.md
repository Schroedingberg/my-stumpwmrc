iq
==

iq is a full screen window manager that does not get in your way. it's ultimate goal is to help you be more productive. 

how does it work
================

every app is in full screen. there is no tiling. there is no overlay window.

it has no eyecandy. (no nav-bar bottom-bar or any kind of bar)

it detecs things that matter to you and send you a message. like: battery is at 10% 

there is no next-window, prev-window... you can call windows: f (for firefox)  e (for emacs) 

you can get a list of windows and their hot keys.

you can call windows without a set hot-key by their number.

iq leaves your mod, super and alt keys alone... instead it uses f9 as default scape key.

use F8 to switch between current and last-checked window. 

how to do ...
=============

i love my current DE because i can listen to music right from the top panel... how do i do it in iq?
F9>i (press F9 and then i to bring the iq command box)
play some music
