This is my-stumpwmrc (config file for stumpwm window manager). I believe it should be useful and/or interesting to many.

Once I log in to my computer I see a welcome message. That's when I know it's ready to accept my commands. There is nothing else to distract me. A blank screen is what I love (usually blue) to start with.  Then I start commanding the computer and see the result of things I want from it. That's what I call a desktop environment that get's the hell out of my way.


On my computer everything is in full screen. 29" of realstate for every app! No tiling or stacking windows. KISS... keep it simple stupid!

If I want to open firefox I press <kbd>F9</kbd> and then <kbd>f</kbd>. 

To computer these key seq means:
<br/>
<kbd>F9</kbd>: hey... here is what I want you to do. <br/>
<kbd>f</kbd>:  switch to the firefox window or start firefox if it's not yet running <br/>

Lets start a terminal window... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd>

Lets open emacs... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd>

Now I want to go back to firefox... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>

Press <kbd>F8</kbd> if you want to switch between last 2 window (emacs & firefox)...

<kbd>F8</kbd> ... and I'm back at my emacs window...

Neat ha? 

There is no numbers... tags... or anything to remember just the first letter of the the apps. Too bad this will never work on mac... everything starts with i... :)

So why <kbd>F9</kbd> and <kbd>F8</kbd>... 

- very few apps use them.
- easy to reach with the most powerful fingers of the right hand.
- no need to mess around with your alt or ctrl key... which is good for a lot of emacs users.

So if you are interested in the way my-stumwmrc work just grab the source code, read thourgh it (it's very short) you will need to alter it a bit... then through it at your stumpwm.

If you do not know what stumpwm is... it's basically a very hackable window manager.

(and '(Have fun!) '(never stop hacking!))
