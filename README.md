Efficent programmer
===================
I live only once, and I want to make it count!

Programming is awesome! it's like dancing with pure logic... even the bugs are a playful tease. If you have the same feelings for programming then this guide myght be useful to you.


Master Googling
===============
A true programmer is also a master of finding things out. If you are not able to figure things out practice it.

For example what is domain address and how can one register a domain address using a programming languge (like PHP) on behalf of someone else.

Touch typing
============
If you already know touch-typing then continue. Else, learn Dvorak.  

Keyboard is the key
===================
I reccomend TypeMatrix. Don't use a laptop keyboard.


19" is the minimum
==================
You need a monitor (preferably LED) that is at least 19"


Learn Gnu+Linux & terminal (bash)
=============================
Start by Ubuntu.
