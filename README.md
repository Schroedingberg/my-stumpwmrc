iq
==

iq is a full screen window manager that does not get in your way. it's ultimate goal is to help you be more productive. it's dependent on stumpwm (an awesome, mature and hackable wm). basicly iq is a config file for stumpwm but it extends and changes it in good ways.

uniqueness
==========

- every app is in full screen. 

- there is 0 eye-candy.

- it is smart. basiclay iq takes care of your repetitive desktop management tasks.

- there is no next-window, prev-window... you can call windows: f (for firefox)  e (for emacs) 

- you can get a list of windows and their hot keys.

- you can call windows without a set hot-key by their number.

- iq leaves your mod, super and alt keys alone... instead it uses F9 as the default scape key.

- use F8 to switch between current and last-checked window. 


installation
============

1. install stumpwm (it's available in all major linux repos)
2. download iq .stumpwmrc (it's stumpwm default config file .stumpwmrc file)
3. backup then replace your current .stumwmrc with the one downloaded from iq

where is my .stumwmrc file?   ~/.stumpwmrc  (for debian)
what about other distros?  i do not know!
