==========

- every app is in full screen. 

- it has no eyecandy. there is no panel. there is no widget.

- it is smart. basiclay iq takes care of your repetitive desktop management tasks.

- there is no next-window, prev-window... you can call windows: f (for firefox)  e (for emacs) 

- you can get a list of windows and their hot keys.

- you can call windows without a set hot-key by their number.

- iq leaves your mod, super and alt keys alone... instead it uses F9 as the default scape key.

- use F8 to switch between current and last-checked window.
